@section adjoint_test_miniapp Adjoint_Test Miniapp

This miniapp forms part of the LFRic and Gungho project. It provides an example of how to write a fully working application that uses the LFRic infrastructure,
but is scientifically straightforward so is easier to understand than a full model.

It creates a field, sets all values of the field to a constant and calculates the divergence of that constant field. Finally, it checks that the divergence of the constant field comes out as zero.

@section psyclone_in_lfric_sec PSyclone in LFRic

The LFRic code uses <a href="https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/lfric/wiki/PsycloneTool">PSyclone tool</a>, which is hosted at the 
<a href="https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone">PSyclone GitHub repository</a>.

One of the PSyclone features used very explicitly in the LFRic code are <a href="https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/blob/master/doc/built_ins.rst">Built-ins</a>:
operations which can be specified within an invoke call in the algorithm layer but do not require an associated kernel to be implemented as they are provided 
directly by the infrastructure.

For more up-to-date information about the <b>LFRic-specific Built-ins</b> functionality (e.g. names, argument order) please refer to the 
<a href="https://github.com/stfc/PSyclone/blob/master/doc/dynamo0p3.rst#built-ins">dynamo 0.3 API Built-ins documentation</a>.
